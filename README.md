  🔄 Decimal to Binary Converter.<br>
  💬 Word Generator.<br>
  📄 Portfolio.

⚠️ Attention: <br><br>
 ℹ️ The decimal to binary converter, has numpad, which converts too but single, you can type the amount number you want then it will be converted to 0 and 1, one observation, the binary code converted dont add the zeros, so, for more precision please consult the ASCII table. <br><br>
 ℹ️ The word generator works with: the ammount of messages you want and the message, so do not put giant values, your browser may not support this okay?, also this project was supposed to be a server log, which in my idea, i was thinking on build something which people who 
 works at datacenter or, data analysis / feedback or something use the system.
